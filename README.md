# University4Me

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
```
University4Me is a site designed to make searching for colleges easier. The user can search for all colleges in the US and the outlying territories based on the schools name, state, territory, city, or by a certain distance from a zip code. The user can also click on a college name to view the schools student size, acceptance rate, the midpoint of SAT/ACT scores the school accepts, and tuition cost. The user will also be able to visit the schools website.
